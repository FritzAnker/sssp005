// Practical Exercise	

* Explore the relationship between passenger class and survival

* 	(1) Create a bar graph of survival rates by passenger class

* 	(2) Create a scatter plot of age versus fare, using colour to represent
*		survival and shape to represent passenger class

* Create a new syntax file using your template.  You can copy & paste and edit syntax from above
* to build up your graphs. Upload your syntax file to GitHub when  you have finished.

* Remember to think about the use of text, colour, shape and labelling in
* producing your graphs.
